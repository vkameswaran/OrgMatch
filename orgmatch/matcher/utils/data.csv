Nothin' But Treble, Georgia Tech's premiere all- female a cappella group, was founded in 1998 by Dipika Jain as part of the Georgia Tech A Cappella Club, along with the guys' a cappella group Sympathetic Vibrations (est. 1997). The group is made up of a variety of Georgia Tech students from Engineering and Biology to STAC majors. There are typically 10 to 12 active members ranging from Freshmen to Graduate students. All of the music in Nothin' But Treble's growing repertoire is arranged by a current or former member of the group. We rehearse at least twice a week and perform at various venues and events. In the past we have performed at the Variety Playhouse in Little 5 Points, for College of Management events, and opened for Nappy Roots, Bubba Sparxxx, and Crime Mob. We've also performed annually at Georgia Tech's PhD Commencement and at the annual Presidential Scholars' weekend. Nothin' but Treble has also competed at SoJam (2012) and the ICCA's (2015), taking home an award for Best Arrangement at the Southeast Regional ICCA competition for ""Chandelier"".

The founders of Nu Mu are chapter are: Larry Hardy, William Saddler, Anthony Thomas, and Ronald Thomas. These four brothers from Alpha Phi chapter, located at Clark College, now Clark Atlanta University, took it upon themselves to begin work on founding a chapter at Southern Tech. Through their diligence and hard work, Nu Mu was founded on April 2, 1977 with the crossing of our charter members, Genesis. These members are Wallace Libscomb, Michael Hill, Robert Mack, Nelson Sheats, Vernon Ford, and Delacy Jordan. The following year, one person entered Alpha Phi Alpha through the Nu Mu Chapter; his name is Gabriel Summerland, The Lonely Warrior.
During this time, a group of young men attending Georgia Tech expressed their interest in Alpha. This group was known as AIM, or Alpha Intended Men. The brothers of Nu Mu petitioned for these men attending Georgia Tech to be initiated into Alpha through the Nu Mu chapter. In the spring of 1978, approval was given to initiate Georgia Tech students Robert Herndon and Ulysses Grady, along with Southern Tech student Donnie Maddux. Thus Three the Hard Way, was born. Brothers Herndon and Grady became the first men of Alpha on the Georgia Tech campus.

Dean of Students Emeritus James Dull and his wife, Gay Dull, are long-time supporters of DramaTech Theatre.","There are a variety of ways to get involved with DramaTech, both technical and artistic (and many that lie somewhere in between). We love new people and take people of any experience level.
These are just a few of the opportunities DramaTech offers:
Show Up!
The best and most effective way to get involved with DramaTech is to just show up. We have a building on campus that many of our members use as their daily hub. As a result, there is almost always someone around who will be more than happy to let you in if you ring the doorbell. Don't hesitate to just drop by between classes, eat lunch with us, or see who's burning the midnight oil.
Club Meetings
Club meetings generally occur every other Wednesday at 6pm during any given semester. Here we discuss business, the status of various productions, committees, etc. Showing up to these is a good way to meet many of members all at once, and maybe even get a crew position for one of DramaTech's shows.
Check the calendar for specific dates.
Work Parties
For those who like a little more structure to their lives, we have work parties throughout the semester. These happen regularly in preparation for shows. The general schedule of work parties is as follows:
Set Parties: Sundays from 1pm to 5pm
Light Parties: Saturdays from 1pm to 5pm
General Parties: Wednesdays from 7pm to 10pm
Check the calendar for specific dates.
Auditions
Auditions are held at the beginning of the semester and are open to Georgia Tech students, faculty, and alumni.

Problem:  
Today, more than two billion people lack access to basic resources, such as clean drinking water, adequate sanitation, reliable passage to local markets and more. EWB-GT is a chapter of EWB-USA, an organization engineering change in 39 countries around the world to change this reality -- one well at a time, one bridge at a time, one community at a time.
Mission and Vision
EWB is a nonprofit humanitarian organization established to support community-driven development programs worldwide through partnerships that design and implement sustainable engineering projects, while creating transformative experiences that enrich global perspectives and create responsible leaders. We envision a world in which the communities we serve have the capacity to sustainably meet their basic human needs.
Each of EWB-GT's seven projects has a unique set of goals specific to the community with which they work.  These goals can range from implementation of sustainably water sources to improved air quality via innovative cookstove design.
How does EWB-GT meet its goals?
The Georgia Tech chapter of Engineers without Borders achieves its goals through collaboration between students and communities.  To efficiently address issues in a variety of diverse communities around the world EWB has in place a unique network of collaboration in which students, mentors, NGO's and community members work together to identify and address the most pressing environmental and health issues.
Projects:
Nicaragua:  EWB-GT's Nicaragua Project is partnered with Rayo del Sol, a NGO focused on improving the lives of children in Nicaragua. The project is designing a cost-effective, sustainable and clean cookstove to improve the health of women and children exposed to current conditions.
Uganda:  This project has already installed solar panels to power the new pump which has replaced the India Mark II hand pump. The next step is to begin the designing and construction of a gravity-fed distribution system. For the impending implementation trip scheduled to occur in August 2016, a 36,000 liter tank will be constructed and the commencement of the construction of a 5 kilometer distribution system.
Cameroon:  EWB-GT's Cameroon Project is working to address health issues in Mungoa-goa by building a solar powered well to provide clean, accessible water to the community.  The well has already been drilled to 70 meters and will require power from 10 Suntech 125W solar panels. To address health related issues, the project has been conducted educational initiatives on each trip to Cameroon.
Wish for Wash:  Wish For WASH designs toilets to bring improved sanitation to those who lack this basic human need. Through our designs, we are reducing the spread of WASH related diseases using a cost-efficient, sustainable, and culturally sensitive product.
New projects are being established in Bolivia and Jamaica as well as a local partnership with an urban farm hear in Atlanta!
Student Roles:
Upon acceptance onto a project members are assigned a committee within which they will work on a specific aspect of a project!
You do not have to be an engineering student to be a productive member of Engineers without Borders!
Communication:  Each project has a communications committee which is responsible for relaying important information to the community in which the team works as well as raising awareness amongst the student body.
Finance:  The finance committee of each project is responsible for raising the funds necessary to allow the project to address the needs of their community.  This is often through grants, sponsorships, fund raisers, etc.
Technical:  The technical committee is the team that work to address the engineering aspects of each project.  This can range from designing wells, researching solar energy, designing cook stoves, etc. depending on the project.
Weekly Project Meetings:  Each project holds its own meeting during which students work as a collective team as well as with their specific committees.  Project goals, updates, and assignments are often detailed during this time.
Bi-Monthly Chapter Meetings:  EWB-GT holds Bi-monthly chapter meetings in which all projects come together to discuss chapter wide progress and important achievements.","In order to become a member, attending an information session is required.

Discover how Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance can bring clarity and peace to your daily life. We offer free meditation classes every week. Falun Dafa is also easy to learn by yourself at your own pace, via online videos and books.

According to a 1917 article of the campus newspaper the Technique, ""The Glee Club was first started in 1906 and was composed of some eight or 10 men who would gather every afternoon under the Academic Building and practice.""
Since that time, the Glee Club has been an outlet for countless Tech students to sing and to enjoy the rich tradition inherent in the group and the university. It has sung on USO tours, on the Ed Sullivan show, and on many tours around the city and around the world. It was even one of the first musical groups to be broadcast on live radio when it sang ""Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech"" along with the Georgia Tech Band in the 1920's.
Today, the Georgia Tech Glee Club is a unique men's a cappella group consisting of around 50 singers. In the last few years, it has sing in Hawaii, Washington, D.C., Carnegie Hall, and the UK, as well as dozens of public and private performances each semester. We produced our first studio recording album in 2006 for our 100th anniversary. The CD, entitled ""Sing, Kindred Voices,"" can be purchased at the GT Bookstore.
Unlike many choral groups, we're extremely flexible. Our music spans all genres: classical, barbershop, rock, popular, folk, and experimental are all styles with which we're comfortable. We can sing for 10 minutes or 2 hours, with 4 people or 50. Abnormal is our way of life, and we wouldn't have it any other way.

A. Our Mission
Each church has a specific role in God's plan of salvation.
We believe JCA exists to multiply, mature, and mobilize passionate followers of Jesus Christ for the glory of God.
B. Our Vision
The heart of JCA is to see a Spirit-empowered, Gospel-spreading movement of God in metro Atlanta and the world, through a community of local churches, so that individuals, communities, and cultures can be transformed in Christ.
In our church community
- Develop mature and equipped followers of Christ with godly character and values.
- Foster a caring, contagious community that expresses God's love to one another.
In the Atlanta area
- Build bridges between JCA and the communities in which our members live and study/work.
- Meet the specific needs of the people of Atlanta through mercy and outreach ministries.
In the world
- Mobilize kingdom workers who will help reach the lost people of the world as well as serve the local church with full devotion. 
- Plant new churches and send out full-time missionaries around the world to strategically fulfill our mission statement.
C. Our Core Values 
Prayer and Spirit-Driven: Life change and the success of the church can only happen through the power and leading of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:12-14; Romans 8:26-28)
Word-Based: God's Word is the primary means by which we can come to know God and become like Him (2 Timothy 3:16, Hebrew 4:12)
Relational Influence: Biblical community is marked by deep relationships of authenticity, accountability, love, and humility towards one another (Acts 2:42-47, 1 Corinthians 13)
Ministry Mindset: Ministry is a mindset, a way of life, in which we are called to serve others with love and sacrifice in order to help meet the physical and spiritual needs of others (Matthew 22:39, Luke 10:29-37, 1 Peter 2:5-9)
Mercy and Justice: We want to magnify God by working for justice on behalf of the poor, the widow, the orphan, and the alien by showing people His mercy through tangible acts of love (Micah 6:8, James 2:14-17, 1 John 3:16-18)
Mission-Focused: As we are transformed by Jesus Christ, we seek to transform the world by advancing the gospel both locally and globally (Matthew 28:19-20, Acts 1:8)","Join us for our Sunday services at East Architecture room 123 at 11am!

It is the beautiful realization of a vision shared commonly by the late Revered Founders Elder Watson Diggs; John Milton Lee; Byron Kenneth Armstrong; Guy Levis Grant; Ezra Dee Alexander; Henry Tourner Asher; Marcus Peter Blakemore; Paul Waymond Caine; Edward Giles Irvin and George Wesley Edmonds.
It was the vision of these astute men that enabled them in the school year 1910 - 11, more specifically the night of January 5, 1911, on the campus of Indiana University at Bloomington, Indiana, to sow the seed of a fraternal tree whose fruit is available to, and now enjoyed by, college men everywhere, regardless of their color, religion or national origin. It is a fact of which KAPPA ALPHA PSI is justly proud that the Constitution has never contained any clause which either excluded or suggested the exclusion of a man from membership merely because of his color, creed, or national origin.

This event occurred in the office of biology Professor Ernest E. Just, the faculty adviser, in the Science Hall (now known as Thirkield Hall). The three liberal arts students were Edgar A. Love, Oscar J. Cooper and Frank Coleman. From the initials of the Greek phrase meaning “friendship is essential to the soul,” the name Omega Psi Phi was derived. The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, scholarship, perseverance and uplift were adopted as cardinal principles. A decision was made regarding the design for the pin and emblem, and thus ended the first meeting of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity .
Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., Delta Kappa Chapter was chartered on Georgia Tech's campus on November 20, 1976, making it the first Black Greek Organization chartered at Georgia Tech.

The Sigma Chi Fraternity was founded at Miami University of Ohio on July 28th, 1855. Today, it is one of the oldest, largest, and most prestigious collegiate fraternities in nation. The fundamental purpose of Sigma Chi is the cultivation, maintenance, and accomplishment of the ideals of friendship, justice, and learning.
BETA PSI CHAPTER HISTORY
In the spring of 1919 several close friends in the student body of Georgia Tech, not satisfied with the bids they had received from the National Chapters, decided to form a local Fraternity with the ultimate aim of petitioning a National Fraternity whose standing was irreproachable and unquestionable. It was finally unanimously decided after a careful study of the various National Fraternities, to work toward Sigma Chi as a goal well worthy of their highest ideals and ambitions.
With the recommendations from the Delta chapter of Sigma Chi at the University of Georgia and the Beta Chi chapter of Sigma Chi at Emory University, along with several recommendations from existing fraternities on the Georgia Tech campus, the Beta Psi chapter of Sigma Chi was officially formed in the spring of 1922. Since its inception the Beta Psi chapter has maintained a strong presence on the campus of Georgia Tech.",,Wednesday,http://www.georgiatechsigmachi.org

This program addresses SLS Student Learning Outcome #2: “Students will be able to demonstrate skills needed to work effectively in different types of communities.” Specifically, students will demonstrate skills needed to: a) recognize diverse types of expertise; b) research a problem in depth, using a variety of methods, exploring multiple perspectives, and connecting community assets and problems to broader trends; and c) collaborate with partners to jointly develop local, sustainable solutions.
The program is also open to a limited number of SLS partners from the nonprofit, community, government, and business sectors.

If you want to compete at the national level, bring home medals, and make a bunch of kickass friends in the process, come talk to us.","In order to join the club officially, students must be cleared by US Parachute Association-licensed instructors to make solo skydives.
In order to obtain this clearance, one must first complete a day-long ground school at Skydive Atlanta, and then the Accelerated Free Fall (AFF) program.  This involves making seven jumps with 1-2 licensed instructors in order to help ensure that the student completes the dive safely.  Once the student finishes all seven AFF levels to their instructors' satisfaction, they'll be allowed to self-supervise and join the club officially.
Ground school and AFF cost about $1,500, assuming one doesn't have to repeat any AFF levels (which is entirely doable, as long as one is careful and attentive).  But, then you can join the club and receive substantial amounts of financial help. You will never be able to skydive for cheaper! Here are some of the benefits of joining the club:
--$24 per jump ($4 off the normal rate)
--$8 per training jump if you decide to compete
--Two free jumps every month
--Free use of club-owned gear (which saves ~$30 a jump for renting or thousands of dollars for buying your own)
--The opportunity to jump, train, compete, and interact with current members and associates
--Free or discounted trips to Collegiate Nationals of skydiving
--Free or discounted indoor skydiving tunnel time
--Coaching and mentorship from current club members, alumni, and a number of world-class skydivers
The club encourages both competitive and leisure jumpers to join! If you want to compete, we will give you all the resources necessary and more to do so. If you don't want to compete, we will still show you a fun time with open arms! We compete every year at USPA Collegiate National Championships. You can come out and compete with us at almost any skill level, or come and support us while still having fun and making jumps on the side!
Some people complete AFF within a couple of weekends, and some spread it out over several months.  The only requirement is that you not allow more than 30 days to elapse between training jumps, or else you will have to repeat the last level successfully completed.

Wreck Racing is an all-student racing team that builds cars for the Grassroots Motorsports $20XX Challenge (see www.grassrootsmotorsports.com).
With a tight budget, the $20XX Challenge favors those with more ingenuity and skill than money.  As many as 100 different teams return each year to battle it out and see who can squeeze the most performance from a penny. Our current Challenge build features a 1987 BMW E28 5-Series featuring a 5.3L LS V8.
Our Members
There are typically three types of people who will join Wreck Racing:
I. These are people who know very little about cars, but would like to know more. Whether it be driving, fixing, breaking, tuning, or even general maintenance these people are in the club to learn as much as they can about cars. Nowhere else at Georgia Tech can you find a club that will provide you with more hands-on experience with real cars. This allows students to finally put their classroom theory into real-life situations.
II. These people are generally experienced gearheads. They know a lot about cars and can tell you anything about cars ranging from normal maintenance to high-performance modifications. More than likely, these people drive a fast car (or more than one of them!) and are pretty good at it! They typically join the club because we can offer them one of the most unique and challenging automotive experiences they will ever have. Building a car for just over $2000 is no easy task. Building a car that can race hard for two days straight for $2000 takes a serious engineering effort.
III. The final type of person usually owns at least two cars (neither of which was purchased for more than $500) and has performed at least one engine swap on both of them. These guys are total car freaks. When they are not trying to piece together a Wreck Racing car, you can probably find them in their own garage trying to piece together their own. Wreck Racing offers these people their car fix while stuck at school.
So come on out and visit the Wreck Racing shop. No matter previous experience, members are able to work on a car that will provide them with welding, CAD design, no end of tuning, tweaking, cutting, painting, wiring, soldering, taping … well, you get the point. If you love cars and have not found your way to our garage, you don't know what you are missing!

Do I need to know how to skate to join?
Nope! We'll teach you everything you need to know from lacing your skates, to learning how to fall (correctly) and being the best skater you can be!
What is roller derby?
Roller derby is a competitive full-body contact sport. It's played on an elliptical track, and players wear quad roller skates and protective padding (helmets, mouth guards, elbow and knee pads, wrist guards). 
How do you win?
There are two positions you can play in roller derby: Blocker (defense) or jammer (offense). Five players from each team are on the track at a time. Four are blockers and one is the jammer. The jammer is designated by a star on their helmet and is the only one who can score points for the team. The jammer scores one point for each opposing player she passes. The blockers from the other team work as a defensive line to stop the jammer from passing them and scoring points. The team with most points at the end of the bout (what we call a game) wins.
How do you play?
At the start of a round, called a ""jam"", the jammers from each team line up behind the jam line while the blockers line up in front of it. When the whistle blows, the jammers attempt to get through all the blockers, called the ""pack"". While neither jammer can score points on their initial pass through the pack, the first jammer to pass every opposing blocker the second time through gets ""lead"" status. This means that they can end the jam at any time they want by ""calling it off"" (signaled by the lead jammer gesturing from her helmet to her hips repeatedly).  The blockers attempt to hold the opposing jammer for as long as possible while helping their own jammer get through the pack. Each jam lasts two minutes, unless called off by the lead jammer, and a game is broken into two thirty minute segments. 
What's the risk?
Roller derby has some inherent hazards associated with it, but safety is always first. Before you are allowed to play, you must first learn (and prove you've learned) basic skating skills to ensure you won't hurt yourself or others. Don't worry, we'll teach you! There are also a lot of rules in place to make sure everyone stays safe. Penalties are issued for numerous grievances, like elbowing or blocking with the head, and these are all to keep the game clean and reduce risk of injury.","General membership is the broadest form of involvement in Yellow Jacket Roller Derby! General members pay dues and sign a participation waiver, so they can attend all of our events as a member of the club.
Recreational membership is the next step. If you are just starting out with roller derby, this is the spot for you! On-skates recreational members pay dues, sign a participation waiver, and also must purchase WFTDA insurance. They are invited to all recreational practices.
Competition membership is for those of you who are ready to test their skills. There are two teams, the A-Team and the B-Team. The A-Team is an attendance-based team, and you must attend at least 60% of practices to be considered for this team. Both teams require you to pass the minimum skills test as outlined by WFTDA as well as the WFTDA written examination. Members who are eligible for these teams will be assessed on skill level, team work, and discipline by the Executive Board before becoming members of a competition team.","Wednesday, Saturday",http://126323.orgsync.com/org/yellowjacketrollerderby

This is not a new beginning but a continuation of a youth movement already brewing in this country. Our objective is to facilitate its success.
The mission of Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) is to identify, educate, train, and mobilize youth activists committed to ""winning on principle."" Our goal is to cast the leaders of tomorrow and reclaim the policies, candidates, and direction of our government.
YAL Statement of Principles
We are the Young Americans for Liberty. We recognize the natural rights of life, liberty, and property set forth by our Founding Fathers. Our country was created to protect the freedoms of the individual and be directed by We the People.
We recognize that freedom requires responsibility, and therefore we hold ourselves to a high standard of character and conduct. Integrity motivates our action. Principle defines our outlook towards government. Peace and prosperity drive our ambitions towards our countrymen.
We inherit a corrupt, coercive world that has lost respect for voluntary action. Our government has failed and dragged our country into moral decay. The political class dominates the agenda with a violent, callous, controlling grip. For this we do not stand.
We welcome limited government conservatives, classical liberals, and libertarians who trust in the creed we set forth.
WE, as Young Americans for Liberty believe:
that government is the negation of liberty; 
that voluntary action is the only ethical behavior; 
that respect for the individual's property is fundamental to a peaceful society;
that violent action is only warranted in defense of one's property; 
that the individual owns his/her body and is therefore responsible for his/her actions;
that society is a responsibility of the people, not the government.","A. Members  of Young Americans for Liberty will be Georgia Tech students who meet eligibility requirements for participation in extra-curricular activities as stated in the GT Catalog and SGA policies.
